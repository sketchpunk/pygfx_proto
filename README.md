# Pygfx Starter Repo

### Setup

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Notes

- All zz\_ files in /pgfx can be run with "Python Debug: Current File"

- To run any file in the proto folder requires you to modify /.vscode/launch.json file. Change the "module" value in the "Hardcoded Module" profile to execute. Then can just press F5 in vscode.
